simple app blah blah

A few things:

- I had to go re-learn some core data.  I was never an expert, but I've made comments where I think it could get better.
- I never really learned auto-layout via the Xcode GUI, and mostly relied on stuff like PureLayout to simplify things, so that could definitely be better as well.
- I watched a talk about writing unit tests against UI code, but that was a few years ago.  Needless to say, there's not a ton of unit tests since it's mostly UI.

Thanks for reading!
